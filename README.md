HTML5 Initializr + Bootstrap + SASS + Wordpress

This is a basic theme that can be used to get started with rapid Wordpress theme development.

It incorporates elements from the HTML5 Initializr Bootstrap. These are combined with Thomas McDonald's SASS mixins for Bootstrap. There is a compass project already initialised monitoring the sass folder. Finally, the theme use the Hybrid theme core from Justin Tadlock for a heap of useful Wordpress/PHP functions.

Enjoy :)
